/* ### Box with Styled Components

Create a new component called `BoxWithStyledComponents`. 
It should feature the same styling as `BoxWithClassName`.

You can use the following hints as guideline:


- It should export a styled component as default export
  - Use a `div` element to style
  - Make use of string interpolation to check the `$isBlack` 
  prop and adjust the background-color accordingly
  - Don't forget to add the styling for the hover effect
- Switch to `./pages/index.js`:
  - import `BoxWithStyledComponents` and
  - below the two `BoxWithClassName` components, render two 
  `BoxWithStyledComponents`, one without and one with the 
  `$isBlack` prop

### Bonus: Aligning Boxes Horizontally

Using styled components, can you align the four boxes horizontally 
by only changing `./pages/index.js`?

- Hint: Use `display: flex` to achieve this goal.

## Notes

- You have to touch the `./pages/index.js` file and add a file 
in the [`components`](./components/) folder. */
